## Data Science

This blog is being constructed to showcase and discuss the data science projects that I have done and am working on. At the moment I am working on my backlog of projects that I havn't written about yet. 

### Predicting Galaxy Masses and Binary Black Hole Fraction
When astronomers observe galaxies through telescopes they have to predict the masses by observing the spectral properties and using Stellar Population Synthesis (SPS) models to determine their composition. In this project I worked with a couple of students at UNC to improve upon these models by including binary star interacations. The [model](https://michael-hoffman.github.io/DG_SPS) is a Bayesian model where we calculate quantities by Monte Carlo sampling. In addtion to better mass predictions we were interested in how often we would expect to find large binary black holes, capable of producing LIGO events, in the relatively numerous types of dwarf galaxies.
